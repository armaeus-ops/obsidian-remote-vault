The phrase "Parallel - Bytes; Seriell - Bits" refers to two distinct methods of data transmission in computing: parallel communication and serial communication, and how they often handle data differently.

### 1. **Parallel Communication (Bytes)**
- In parallel communication, **multiple bits** are transmitted **simultaneously** over multiple channels or wires.
- For example, if you're transmitting 8 bits (1 byte), all 8 bits can be sent at the same time over 8 parallel channels. This allows for faster data transfer in short distances, but requires more wires.
- Parallel communication is often associated with high-speed data transfer, but it becomes less efficient for long distances because of issues like signal degradation and synchronization problems.
- Example: Parallel ports in older computers (e.g., printer connections using a Centronics cable).

### 2. **Serial Communication (Bits)**
- In serial communication, **one bit** is transmitted **at a time**, sequentially, over a single channel or wire.
- Although it sends data one bit after the other, serial communication is often preferred for long-distance transmission because it is less prone to signal degradation and is simpler in terms of wiring.
- Over time, serial communication has been optimized to be very fast, often outpacing parallel communication for many use cases.
- Example: USB, Ethernet, and most modern communication protocols are serial.

In summary, "Parallel - Bytes" reflects the idea that parallel communication can transmit a **byte** (or more) of data simultaneously, while "Seriell - Bits" reflects that serial communication transmits data **bit by bit** sequentially.
