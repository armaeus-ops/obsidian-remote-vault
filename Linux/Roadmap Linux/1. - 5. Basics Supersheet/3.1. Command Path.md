Topic 103: GNU and Unix Commands

The Command Path (often referred to as just "PATH") is a fundamental concept in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. Here are the key points to understand:

1. Definition: The PATH is an environment variable that tells the shell where to look for executable files when you type a command.
2. Structure: It's a colon-separated list of directories. For example: `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
3. Order matters: The shell searches these directories in order from left to right when you enter a command.
4. Default PATH: The system comes with a default PATH, but users can modify it.
5. Viewing the PATH: You can see your current PATH by typing `echo $PATH` in the terminal.
6. Modifying the PATH: You can add directories to your PATH temporarily (for the current session) or permanently (by editing configuration files like .bashrc).
7. Security implications: Adding directories to the PATH, especially at the beginning, can pose security risks if malicious executables are placed in those directories.
8. Command resolution: When you type a command, the shell checks each directory in the PATH until it finds an executable with that name or exhausts the list.
9. Which command: The `which` command can be used to see which version of a command will be executed based on your current PATH.
10. Relative vs. Absolute paths: Commands in the current directory (./) are not typically in the PATH for security reasons. You need to use ./ or the full path to run them.

Understanding the PATH is crucial for effective command-line usage and troubleshooting in Linux environments. It's especially important for system administrators and developers who need to manage multiple versions of software or custom scripts.

```
echo $PATH
```

Running this command in a Linux terminal will return all the directories that the shell will search, in order, to find the command it has to run. The directories are separated by a colon.

This feature makes using Linux command-line interface convenient and efficient.
