In Linux, environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the behavior of running processes in a shell. They exist in every shell session. A shell session’s environment includes, but is not limited to, the user’s home directory, command search path, terminal type, and program preferences.

Environment variables help to contribute to the fantastic and customizable flexibility you see in Unix systems. They provide a simple way to share configuration settings between multiple applications and processes in Linux.

You can use the ‘env’ command to list all the environment variables in a shell session. If you want to print a particular variable, such as the PATH variable, you can use the ‘echo $PATH’ command.

Here’s an example of how you would do that:

```
# List all environment variables
$ env

# Print a particular variable like PATH
$ echo $PATH
```

Remember, every shell, such as Bourne shell, C shell, or Korn shell in Unix or Linux has different syntax and semantics to define and use environment variables.

Certainly. Environment Variables are another crucial concept in Unix-like operating systems. Here are the key points to understand about Environment Variables:

1. Definition: Environment variables are dynamic values that affect the processes running on a computer system. They are part of the environment in which a process runs.
2. Purpose: They store information about the system environment, user preferences, and can be used to configure program behavior.
3. Naming convention: Typically in uppercase, though this is a convention, not a rule.
4. Common variables: Some common ones include PATH, HOME, USER, SHELL, PWD, etc.
5. Viewing variables: You can see all environment variables using the `env` command, or a specific one with `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`.
6. Setting variables:
    - Temporarily: `export VARIABLE_NAME=value` in the current shell session.
    - Permanently: Add to files like ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or /etc/environment.
7. Unsetting variables: Use the `unset` command, e.g., `unset VARIABLE_NAME`.
8. Inheritance: Child processes inherit environment variables from their parent process.
9. System-wide vs. user-specific: Some variables are system-wide, others are user-specific.
10. Use in scripts: Environment variables are often used in shell scripts for configuration and to pass information.
11. Security considerations: Sensitive information (like passwords) should not be stored in environment variables, as they can be easily viewed.
12. Variable expansion: In scripts and command line, $VARIABLE_NAME or ${VARIABLE_NAME} is used to expand the variable's value.
