The shell in Linux provides a robust way of managing input and output streams of a command or program, this mechanism is known as Redirection. Linux being a multi-user and multi-tasking operating system, every process typically has 3 streams opened:

- Standard Input (stdin) - This is where the process reads its input from. The default is the keyboard.
- Standard Output (stdout) - The process writes its output to stdout. By default, this means the terminal.
- Standard Error (stderr) - The process writes error messages to stderr. This also goes to the terminal by default.

Redirection in Linux allows us to manipulate these streams, advancing the flexibility with which commands or programs are run. Besides the default devices (keyboard for input and terminal for output), the I/O streams can be redirected to files or other devices.

For example, if you want to store the output of a command into a file instead of printing it to the console, we can use the ’>’ operator.

```
ls -al > file_list.txt
```

This command will write the output of ‘ls -al’ into ‘file_list.txt’, whether or not the file initially existed. It will be created if necessary, and if it already exists – it will be overwritten.

Here's an overview of the key points about redirects:

1. Definition: Redirects allow you to control where the input comes from and where the output goes for a command.
2. Standard streams: There are three standard I/O streams:
    - stdin (0): Standard input
    - stdout (1): Standard output
    - stderr (2): Standard error
3. Output redirection:
    - `>`: Redirects stdout to a file, overwriting its contents
    - `>>`: Appends stdout to a file
    - Example: `ls > file_list.txt`
4. Input redirection:
    - `<`: Redirects input from a file
    - Example: `sort < unsorted_list.txt`
5. Error redirection:
    - `2>`: Redirects stderr to a file
    - Example: `command 2> error_log.txt`
6. Combining redirects:
    - `command > output.txt 2> error.txt`: Redirects stdout and stderr to separate files
    - `command &> all_output.txt`: Redirects both stdout and stderr to the same file
7. Here documents:
    - `<<`: Allows input of multiple lines
    - Example: `cat << EOF > file.txt`
8. Discarding output:
    - Redirect to /dev/null to discard output
    - Example: `command > /dev/null 2>&1`
9. Piping:
    - `|`: Sends the output of one command as input to another
    - Example: `ls | sort`
10. tee command:
    - Allows you to redirect output to a file and still see it in the terminal
    - Example: `command | tee output.txt`
