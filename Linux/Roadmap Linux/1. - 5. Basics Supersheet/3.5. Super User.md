The Super User, also known as “root user”, represents a user account in Linux with extensive powers, privileges, and capabilities. This user has complete control over the system and can access any data stored on it. This includes the ability to modify system configurations, change other user’s passwords, install software, and perform more administrative tasks in the shell environment.

The usage of super user is critical to operating a Linux system properly and safely as it can potentially cause serious damage. The super user can be accessed through the `sudo` or `su` commands.

Specifically, `su` switches the current user to the root, whereas `sudo` allows you to run a command as another user, default being root. However, they also have a key difference which is `sudo` will log the commands and its arguments which can be a handy audit trail.

```
# This would prompt for root password and switch you to root usermode
$ su -

# To perform a command as superuser (if allowed in sudoers list)
$ sudo <command>
```

Note that super user privileges should be handled with care due to their potential to disrupt the system’s functionality. Mistaken changes to key system files or unauthorized access can lead to severe issues.

Certainly. The concept of Superuser is crucial in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. Here's an overview of the key points about Superuser:

1. Definition: The Superuser (often called "root") is the user account with the highest level of access to the operating system.
2. User ID: The root user always has a user ID of 0.
3. Privileges: The Superuser can perform any operation on the system, including modifying system files, installing software, and managing other user accounts.
4. Access: Normal users can temporarily gain Superuser privileges using commands like `su` or `sudo`.
5. su (Switch User):
    - Allows you to switch to the root user account
    - Usage: `su -` or `su - root`
6. sudo (Superuser Do):
    - Allows execution of a single command with root privileges
    - Usage: `sudo command`
    - Configuration file: /etc/sudoers
7. Security implications:
    - Using root privileges unnecessarily can pose security risks
    - It's recommended to use sudo for specific tasks rather than logging in as root
8. Root prompt: Often denoted by a # symbol instead of $ in the command prompt
9. Home directory: The root user's home directory is typically /root
10. Best practices:
    - Limit the number of users with sudo access
    - Use sudo instead of logging in as root
    - Always be cautious when using Superuser privileges
