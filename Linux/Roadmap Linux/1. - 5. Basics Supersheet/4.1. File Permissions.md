In Linux systems, rights and privileges are assigned to files and directories in the form of permissions. These permissions indicate who can read, write, or execute (run) them. In Linux, there are three types of users: owners, groups, and others who can have a different set of permissions.

In fact, permissions on the system are there for a reason: to prevent unprivileged users from making changes on the system that would ultimately affect other users. With inadequate permissions, unprivileged users are able to make changes that would be beneficial or harmless to the Linux system.

Letâ€™s have a look at an example:

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 12:00 filename
```

From the above example, the first character `-` indicates if it is a regular file(`-`) or directory(`d`). The following group of three characters(`rwx`) represents the permissions for the file owner. The next three characters(`r--`) represent permissions for the group and the last set of three characters(`r--`) represents permissions for others.

The `r` indicates that the file can be read, `w` indicates that the file can be written to, and `x` indicates that the file can be executed.

The permissions can be changed using the `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands.

Let's dive deeper into file permissions, which is a crucial concept in Linux systems.

1. Basic Concept:
    - Every file and directory in Linux has three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
    - These permissions are set for three categories of users: owner (u), group (g), and others (o).
2. Viewing Permissions:
    - Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions.
    - The output looks like: -rwxrw-r-- (10 characters)
        - First character: file type (- for regular file, d for directory)
        - Next 3 characters: owner permissions
        - Next 3 characters: group permissions
        - Last 3 characters: others permissions
3. Meaning of Permissions:
    - For files:
        - r (read): Can view the contents
        - w (write): Can modify the contents
        - x (execute): Can run the file as a program
    - For directories:
        - r (read): Can list the contents
        - w (write): Can add or remove files
        - x (execute): Can enter the directory and access its files
4. Numeric Representation:
    - r = 4
    - w = 2
    - x = 1
    - Permissions are often represented as a 3-digit number, e.g., 755, where:
        - 7 (4+2+1) = rwx for owner
        - 5 (4+0+1) = r-x for group
        - 5 (4+0+1) = r-x for others
5. Changing Permissions:
    - Use the `chmod` command
    - Symbolic mode: `chmod u+x file` (adds execute permission for owner)
    - Numeric mode: `chmod 644 file` (sets rw-r--r--)
6. Changing Ownership:
    - Use the `chown` command to change owner
    - Use the `chgrp` command to change group
    - Example: `chown user:group file`
7. Special Permissions:
    - SUID (Set User ID): 4000
    - SGID (Set Group ID): 2000
    - Sticky Bit: 1000
8. Default Permissions:
    - Controlled by the `umask` command
    - umask sets the default permissions for newly created files and directories
9. Access Control Lists (ACLs):
    - Provides more fine-grained access control
    - Use `getfacl` and `setfacl` commands
