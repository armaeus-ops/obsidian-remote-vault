Linux offers powerful utilities for archiving, where multiple files and directories are combined into a single file, primarily for backup and simplification of distribution. The main tools used for this purpose are `tar`, `gzip`, and `bzip2`.

The `tar` command, originally for tape archiving, is a versatile tool that can manage and organize files into one archive. Meanwhile, `gzip` and `bzip2` are used for file compression, reducing the file size and making data transmission easier.

Take a look at the following commands in use:

```
# To create a tar archive:
tar cvf archive_name.tar directory_to_archive/

# To extract a tar archive:
tar xvf archive_name.tar

# To create a gzip compressed tar archive:
tar cvzf archive_name.tar.gz directory_to_archive/

#To create a bzip2 compressed tar archive:
tar cvjf archive_name.tar.bz2 directory_to_archive/
```

Remember, in Linux, archiving and compression are separate processes, hence `tar` to archive and `gzip`/`bzip2` to compress. Although theyâ€™re commonly used together, they can very much be used separately as per the requirements.

Certainly. Archiving and compressing are important skills for managing files in Linux systems. Let's break this down:

1. Archiving:
    
    - Definition: Combining multiple files or directories into a single file.
    - Main tool: tar (Tape Archive)
    
    Key tar commands:
    
    - Create archive: `tar -cvf archive.tar files`
    - Extract archive: `tar -xvf archive.tar`
    - List contents: `tar -tvf archive.tar`
    
    Options:
    - c: Create a new archive
    - x: Extract files from an archive
    - v: Verbose mode (list files processed)
    - f: Specify the archive file
    - t: List the contents of an archive
2. Compression: Main tools: a) gzip:
    
    - Compress: `gzip file`
    - Decompress: `gunzip file.gz` or `gzip -d file.gz`
    
    b) bzip2:
    
    - Compress: `bzip2 file`
    - Decompress: `bunzip2 file.bz2` or `bzip2 -d file.bz2`
    
    c) xz:
    - Compress: `xz file`
    - Decompress: `unxz file.xz` or `xz -d file.xz`
3. Combining Archiving and Compression:
    
    - gzip: `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz files`
    - bzip2: `tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 files`
    - xz: `tar -cJvf archive.tar.xz files`
    
    To extract:
    - `tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz`
    - `tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2`
    - `tar -xJvf archive.tar.xz`
4. Other Archiving Tools:
    - cpio: Used for creating archives, especially in conjunction with find
    - dd: Used for copying files, converting file formats, and creating disk images
5. Compression Ratios: Generally: xz > bzip2 > gzip (in terms of compression efficiency)
6. Best Practices:
    - Use .tar.gz for general-purpose archiving and compressing
    - Use .tar.xz when maximum compression is needed
    - Always verify archives after creation
