### Harden SSH on Rocky Linux:

#### 1. Use SSH Keys Instead of Password Authentication

- **Generate an SSH key pair** on your local machine (if you don’t already have one):
  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096a<
   ```
  This will generate a private and public key pair.

- **Copy your public key to the server**:
  ```
  ssh-copy-id user@server_ip
  ```

  Or manually copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on your local machine to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

- **Disable password authentication** by editing the `sshd_config` file:
  ```
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```
  Find and set the following:
  ```
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```
  Then restart the SSH service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```

### 2. Change the Default SSH Port

- Find the line that says `#Port 22` and change it to a different port (e.g., 2222):
- Make sure the new port is allowed by your firewall:
  ```
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

### 3. Disable Root Login
  ```
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

### 4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

For added security, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) using `Google Authenticator` or a similar tool.

- Install the `pam_google_authenticator` package:
  ```
  sudo dnf install google-authenticator
  ```

- Configure each user for 2FA by running `google-authenticator` and following the prompts:
  ```
  google-authenticator
  ```

- Enable `PAM` support for SSH:
  Edit `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:
  ```
  sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
  ```

  Add this line at the top:
  ```
  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
  ```

- In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, enable `ChallengeResponseAuthentication`:
  ```
  ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
  ```

  Then restart the SSH service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```

### 5. Limit Users Who Can SSH

- Add the following lines to allow only specific users (replace `user1` and `user2` with actual usernames):
  ```
  AllowUsers user1 user2
  ```

  Or, to allow only members of a certain group:
  ```
  AllowGroups sshusers
  ```
### 6. Set Idle Timeout for Sessions

To automatically disconnect idle users, set a timeout.

- In `sshd_config`, add the following:
  ```
  ClientAliveInterval 300
  ClientAliveCountMax 0
  ```

  This will disconnect users after 5 minutes of inactivity.

### 7. Use Fail2Ban to Block Brute-Force Attempts

Install `fail2ban` to automatically block IP addresses that attempt multiple failed SSH logins.

- Install `fail2ban`:
  ```
  sudo dnf install fail2ban
  ```

- Enable and start the service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
  sudo systemctl start fail2ban
  ```

- Create a configuration file for SSH protection:
  ```
  sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  ```

  Add the following:
  ```
  [sshd]
  enabled = true
  port = 2222  # Replace with your actual SSH port
  filter = sshd
  logpath = /var/log/secure
  maxretry = 3
  ```

  Restart `fail2ban`:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
  ```

### 8. Use a Firewall

Ensure that only trusted IP addresses can access SSH by configuring your firewall (using `firewalld` or `iptables`).

- Example using `firewalld` to allow SSH only from a specific IP:
  ```
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='your-ip-address' port protocol='tcp' port='2222' accept"
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

### 9. Install and Configure Security Updates

Keep your system and packages up to date:

- Enable automatic updates for security patches:
  ```
  sudo dnf install dnf-automatic
  sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
  ```

This ensures that your server is always patched against known vulnerabilities.
