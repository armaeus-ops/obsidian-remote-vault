Certainly. Here's how to list installed packages for Fedora, Arch, Red Hat, and Debian-based systems:

1. Fedora and Red Hat (DNF/RPM):

List all installed packages:
```
dnf list installed
```

or using RPM:
```
rpm -qa
```

List a specific installed package:
```
dnf list installed | grep package_name
```

2. Arch Linux (pacman):

List all installed packages:
```
pacman -Q
```

List explicitly installed packages (not dependencies):
```
pacman -Qe
```

List a specific installed package:
```
pacman -Qs package_name
```

3. Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu, uses apt):

List all installed packages:
```
apt list --installed
```

or using dpkg:
```
dpkg -l
```

List a specific installed package:
```
apt list --installed | grep package_name
```

Key points to remember:

- These commands often produce long outputs. You might want to pipe them to `less` for easier viewing, e.g., `dnf list installed | less`
- You can use grep to filter results, e.g., `dpkg -l | grep package_name`
- Some commands provide more detailed information than others

Additional useful commands:

For Fedora/Red Hat:
- `rpm -qi package_name`: Get detailed information about an installed package

For Arch:
- `pacman -Qi package_name`: Get detailed information about an installed package

For Debian:
- `dpkg -s package_name`: Get detailed information about an installed package

LPIC-1 Coverage:

This topic is primarily covered in:

Topic 102: Linux Installation and Package Management
Subtopic 102.4: Use Debian package management
Subtopic 102.5: Use RPM and YUM package management

The exam objectives typically include:

- Querying package databases for package information
- Listing installed packages
- Identifying which package a file belongs to

While the specific commands might not all be tested, understanding how to list and query installed packages across different distributions is an important skill for Linux system administrators.

Remember, the exact output and available options might vary depending on the specific version of the package manager and the Linux distribution you're using.
