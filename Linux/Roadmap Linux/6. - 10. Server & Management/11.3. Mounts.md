### 11.3. Mounts and Mounting in Linux

Mounting in Linux is the process of making a filesystem accessible at a certain point in the directory tree. Understanding mounts and the process of mounting is essential for managing storage devices, accessing external drives, and handling filesystems in Linux.

#### 1. **What is Mounting?**

Mounting is the act of attaching a filesystem to a specified directory, known as the mount point, so that it becomes part of the overall directory structure of the system. When a filesystem is mounted, users and applications can access files and directories on that filesystem as if they were part of the root directory (`/`).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Mount Point**: A directory where the filesystem is attached. For example, `/mnt`, `/media`, or any other directory you choose.
- **Unmounting**: The process of detaching the filesystem from the directory tree, making it inaccessible until it is mounted again.

#### 2. **Basic Mounting Commands**

**a. Mounting a Filesystem**
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt/mydir
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This command mounts the filesystem located on the specified partition (`/dev/sdXn`) to the directory `/mnt/mydir`.
  - **Example**: To mount a USB drive, you might use:
    ```bash
    sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
    ```

**b. Viewing Mounted Filesystems**
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  mount
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Displays a list of currently mounted filesystems along with their mount points, device names, and mount options.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Displays disk usage of mounted filesystems in a human-readable format, showing how much space is used and available.

**c. Unmounting a Filesystem**
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/mydir
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Unmounts the filesystem from the directory `/mnt/mydir`. It's important to unmount a filesystem before removing the storage device to avoid data corruption.

**d. Remounting a Filesystem**
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mount -o remount,rw /mnt/mydir
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Remounts a filesystem, often used to change its mount options, such as switching from read-only to read-write mode.

#### 3. **Mount Options**

When mounting a filesystem, you can specify various options to control its behavior. These options are usually passed with the `-o` flag in the `mount` command.

**Common Mount Options**:
- **ro/rw**: Mount the filesystem as read-only (`ro`) or read-write (`rw`).
- **noatime**: Do not update the access time on files, improving performance.
- **auto/noauto**: Automatically mount the filesystem at boot (`auto`) or require manual mounting (`noauto`).
- **user/nouser**: Allow (or disallow) ordinary users to mount the filesystem.
- **exec/noexec**: Allow (or disallow) execution of binaries on the mounted filesystem.

**Example**:
```bash
sudo mount -o rw,noatime /dev/sdXn /mnt/mydir
```
This command mounts the filesystem as read-write and disables the updating of file access times.

#### 4. **Automounting with `/etc/fstab`**

The `/etc/fstab` file contains a list of filesystems to be automatically mounted at boot time. It defines the relationship between devices and their mount points, along with any specific mount options.

**Example `/etc/fstab` Entry**:
```plaintext
/dev/sdXn  /mnt/mydir  ext4  defaults  0  2
```
- **/dev/sdXn**: The device or partition to be mounted.
- **/mnt/mydir**: The mount point where the filesystem will be attached.
- **ext4**: The type of filesystem.
- **defaults**: Mount options (default includes rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async).
- **0 2**: The dump and pass options, where `0` disables dump, and `2` sets the order in which filesystems are checked.

To apply changes made in `/etc/fstab` without rebooting:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mount -a
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Mounts all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab` that are not currently mounted.

#### 5. **Mounting Network Filesystems**

Network filesystems allow you to mount directories from remote servers over the network, integrating them into your local directory tree.

**Common Network Filesystems**:
- **NFS (Network File System)**:
  - **Command**:
    ```bash
    sudo mount -t nfs server:/remote/dir /mnt/localdir
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Mounts an NFS share from `server:/remote/dir` to the local mount point `/mnt/localdir`.

- **SMB/CIFS (Windows File Sharing)**:
  - **Command**:
    ```bash
    sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/localdir -o username=user,password=pass
    ```
    - **Explanation**: Mounts a CIFS/SMB share from `//server/share` to the local mount point `/mnt/localdir`.

#### 6. **Troubleshooting Mount Issues**

**Common Issues**:
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to mount the filesystem, often requiring `sudo`.
- **Mount Point Busy**: If the mount point is in use, you may need to close any open files or directories using that mount point before unmounting.
- **Filesystem Not Found**: Verify the device path or network share is correct and accessible.

**Log Files**:
- Check system logs for mount errors using:
  ```bash
  dmesg | grep mount
  ```

#### 7. **LPIC Reference**

**LPIC Topic**:
- **Topic 104: Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**
- **Subtopic 104.5: Mount and unmount filesystems**

**Key Points**:
- Understand the process of mounting and unmounting filesystems, including using the `mount` and `umount` commands.
- Be familiar with the `/etc/fstab` file for automating mounts at boot time.
- Know how to mount network filesystems like NFS and SMB/CIFS.
- Learn how to specify and use mount options for better control over filesystem behavior.

### Summary

- **Mounting** is the process of attaching a filesystem to the directory tree, making it accessible to the system.
- **Basic Commands**: `mount`, `umount`, and `df` are essential for managing mounted filesystems.
- **Mount Options**: Control how filesystems are mounted using options like `rw`, `noatime`, and `user`.
- **Automounting**: Use the `/etc/fstab` file to define filesystems to be automatically mounted at boot.
- **Network Mounting**: Mount remote filesystems using NFS or SMB/CIFS protocols.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues include permission problems, busy mount points, and incorrect device paths, which can often be diagnosed using system logs.

Understanding mounts and mounting is critical for system administration, as it directly impacts how storage is organized, accessed, and managed in a Linux environment.
