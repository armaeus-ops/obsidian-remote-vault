### 11.4. Adding Disks and Partitioning in Linux

Adding new disks and partitioning them is a crucial task for managing storage in Linux. This process involves recognizing new storage devices, partitioning them according to your needs, formatting the partitions with appropriate filesystems, and finally mounting them for use.

#### 1. **Recognizing New Disks**

When you add a new disk to a Linux system, it needs to be recognized by the operating system before you can partition and use it.

**Check for New Disks**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo fdisk -l
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Lists all available disks and their partitions. Newly added disks will be listed, typically as `/dev/sdX` (where `X` is a letter assigned to the disk).

- **Alternative**:
  ```bash
  lsblk
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Displays all block devices in a tree format, showing disks and their partitions.

If the new disk does not appear, you might need to rescan for new devices:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  echo "- - -" | sudo tee /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Forces a rescan of the SCSI bus to detect new devices, where `hostX` corresponds to your SCSI host (e.g., `host0`).

#### 2. **Partitioning a Disk**

Partitioning divides a disk into sections that can be managed separately. This is useful for organizing data, creating different filesystems, or setting up swap space.

**Using `fdisk` for MBR/GPT Partitioning**:

- **Start `fdisk`**:
  ```bash
  sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Opens the disk `/dev/sdX` for partitioning using `fdisk`.

**Key `fdisk` Commands**:
- **List partitions**: Type `p` and press Enter to list the existing partitions.
- **Create a new partition**: Type `n` to create a new partition, and follow the prompts to specify the type (primary, extended), partition number, start, and end sectors.
- **Set partition type**: Type `t` to change the partition type (e.g., `82` for Linux swap, `83` for Linux filesystems).
- **Write changes**: Type `w` to write the partition table to the disk and exit.

**Using `parted` for Advanced Partitioning**:
- **Start `parted`**:
  ```bash
  sudo parted /dev/sdX
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Opens the disk `/dev/sdX` for partitioning using `parted`, which supports both MBR and GPT partitioning schemes.

**Key `parted` Commands**:
- **Create a GPT partition table**:
  ```bash
  mklabel gpt
  ```
- **Create a new partition**:
  ```bash
  mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 100%
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Creates a primary partition with ext4 filesystem type starting at 1 MiB and using the rest of the disk.

- **View partition layout**:
  ```bash
  print
  ```

#### 3. **Formatting Partitions**

After partitioning the disk, each partition must be formatted with a filesystem before it can be used.

**Common Filesystems**:
- **ext4**: Suitable for most Linux systems.
- **XFS**: Ideal for large-scale, high-performance environments.
- **Btrfs**: Offers advanced features like snapshots and subvolumes.

**Format a Partition**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXn
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Formats the partition `/dev/sdXn` with the ext4 filesystem.

**Create a Swap Partition**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mkswap /dev/sdXn
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Formats the partition `/dev/sdXn` as swap space.

#### 4. **Mounting Partitions**

Once the partitions are formatted, they can be mounted to make them accessible.

**Mount a Partition**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt/mydir
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Mounts the partition `/dev/sdXn` to the directory `/mnt/mydir`.

To make this mount permanent, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:
- **Example `/etc/fstab` Entry**:
  ```plaintext
  /dev/sdXn  /mnt/mydir  ext4  defaults  0  2
  ```

**Enable Swap**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo swapon /dev/sdXn
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Activates the swap partition, making it available for use.

To make this change permanent, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:
- **Example `/etc/fstab` Entry**:
  ```plaintext
  /dev/sdXn  swap  swap  defaults  0  0
  ```

#### 5. **Resizing Partitions**

You may need to resize a partition to expand or shrink it, depending on your storage needs.

**Using `resize2fs` for ext4**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo resize2fs /dev/sdXn
  ```
  - **Explanation**: Resizes the ext4 filesystem on the partition `/dev/sdXn` to fit its new size.

Before resizing a partition, unmount it if it's currently mounted:
- **Unmount**:
  ```bash
  sudo umount /dev/sdXn
  ```

**LPIC Topic**:
- **Topic 104: Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**
- **Subtopic 104.6: Create, delete, or modify partitions**

**Key Points**:
- Understand how to add and recognize new disks in Linux.
- Be able to partition disks using tools like `fdisk` and `parted`.
- Know how to format partitions with appropriate filesystems.
- Understand how to mount and make filesystems available for use.
- Be familiar with resizing partitions and modifying partition tables.

### Summary

- **Adding New Disks**: Recognize newly added storage devices using tools like `fdisk` and `lsblk`.
- **Partitioning**: Use `fdisk` or `parted` to create, delete, or modify disk partitions.
- **Formatting**: Prepare partitions for use by formatting them with filesystems like ext4, XFS, or Btrfs.
- **Mounting**: Attach partitions to the directory tree to make them accessible.
- **Managing Swap**: Create and enable swap space for system memory management.
- **Resizing**: Modify partition sizes as needed to adapt to changing storage requirements.

Adding and partitioning disks in Linux is a fundamental skill for managing storage, ensuring that your system's filesystems are appropriately structured and optimized for performance and data management.
