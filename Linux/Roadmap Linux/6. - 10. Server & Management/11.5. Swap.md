### 11.5. Swap in Linux

Swap space in Linux is a designated area on a storage device used as virtual memory when the system's physical RAM is fully utilized. It helps ensure system stability by providing additional memory resources, though it is slower than using physical RAM.

#### 1. **What is Swap?**

Swap is a special partition or a file on the storage device that the Linux kernel uses as an overflow space for RAM. When the physical memory (RAM) is exhausted, the operating system moves inactive pages from RAM to the swap space, freeing up RAM for active processes.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Swap Partition**: A dedicated partition on a disk specifically for swap usage.
- **Swap File**: A file within a filesystem that is used as swap space.
- **Swappiness**: A kernel parameter that determines how aggressively the system moves data from RAM to swap.

#### 2. **Setting Up Swap**

**a. Creating a Swap Partition**

1. **Identify the disk** where you want to create the swap partition using `fdisk` or `parted`.

   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
   ```

2. **Create the partition** using `n` to create a new partition, then set its type to Linux swap using `t` and the code `82`.

3. **Write changes** to the disk using `w`.

4. **Format the partition as swap**:

   ```bash
   sudo mkswap /dev/sdXn
   ```

   - **Explanation**: `/dev/sdXn` is the partition you just created.

5. **Activate the swap partition**:

   ```bash
   sudo swapon /dev/sdXn
   ```

   - **Explanation**: This command enables the swap partition, making it available for use.

**b. Creating a Swap File**

If you don't want to use a dedicated partition, you can create a swap file within an existing filesystem.

1. **Create an empty file** to be used as swap:

   ```bash
   sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
   ```

   - **Explanation**: This creates a 2GB file named `/swapfile`. Adjust the size as needed.

   If `fallocate` is not available, you can use `dd`:

   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048
   ```

2. **Secure the swap file** by restricting access:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   ```

   - **Explanation**: This sets the correct permissions to ensure only the root user can read or write to the swap file.

3. **Format the file as swap**:

   ```bash
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   ```

4. **Enable the swap file**:

   ```bash
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   ```

**c. Making Swap Permanent**

To ensure that the swap partition or file is enabled at boot, add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file.

- **For a Swap Partition**:
  ```plaintext
  /dev/sdXn  none  swap  sw  0  0
  ```

- **For a Swap File**:
  ```plaintext
  /swapfile  none  swap  sw  0  0
  ```

After editing `/etc/fstab`, verify the changes:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
```

#### 3. **Managing Swap**

**a. Adjusting Swappiness**

Swappiness is a kernel parameter that controls the relative weight given to swapping out memory pages. The value ranges from 0 (less swapping) to 100 (aggressive swapping).

- **Check the current swappiness**:

  ```bash
  cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
  ```

- **Temporarily change swappiness**:

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
  ```

- **Permanently change swappiness** by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

  ```plaintext
  vm.swappiness=10
  ```

- **Explanation**: A lower value means the system will avoid using swap space unless absolutely necessary, while a higher value means the system will use swap more readily.

**b. Monitoring Swap Usage**

- **Check swap usage**:

  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Displays the amount of used and available swap space in a human-readable format.

- **Display swap details**:

  ```bash
  sudo swapon --show
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Shows detailed information about swap areas, including size, priority, and usage.

**c. Disabling Swap**

You may need to disable swap temporarily or permanently:

- **To disable all swap**:

  ```bash
  sudo swapoff -a
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Disables all swap areas currently in use.

- **To disable a specific swap area**:

  ```bash
  sudo swapoff /dev/sdXn
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Disables the swap partition or file `/dev/sdXn`.

To remove a swap file permanently, delete its entry from `/etc/fstab` and then delete the file:

```bash
sudo rm /swapfile
```

#### 4. **Swap Best Practices**

- **Size Considerations**: Traditionally, swap space was recommended to be twice the size of RAM, but this depends on your workload. For modern systems, 1-2 times the size of RAM is usually sufficient, depending on whether you need hibernation support.
- **Use a Swap File**: For flexibility, consider using a swap file instead of a partition, as it can be resized more easily.
- **Monitor Swap Usage**: Regularly monitor swap usage to ensure your system is not over-reliant on it, which can lead to performance degradation.

#### 5. **LPIC Reference**

**LPIC Topic**:
- **Topic 104: Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**
- **Subtopic 104.6: Create and configure swap space**

**Key Points**:
- Understand how to create, activate, and manage swap partitions and files.
- Be familiar with the swappiness parameter and how it influences memory management.
- Know how to monitor swap usage and make swap space available or unavailable as needed.

### Summary

- **Swap Space**: Acts as virtual memory to supplement physical RAM, helping manage memory usage when RAM is fully utilized.
- **Creating Swap**: You can create a dedicated swap partition or a swap file within an existing filesystem.
- **Managing Swap**: Enable, disable, and adjust swappiness to control swap behavior.
- **Best Practices**: Choose appropriate swap sizes, monitor usage, and consider using swap files for flexibility.

Understanding swap management is vital for maintaining system performance, particularly on systems with limited RAM or when running memory-intensive applications. Proper configuration and monitoring of swap space can help prevent system slowdowns and ensure smooth operation.
