### 11.6. Logical Volume Management (LVM) in Linux

Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a flexible and powerful system for managing disk storage in Linux. LVM allows you to create, resize, and manage disk partitions more efficiently than traditional partitioning schemes, offering greater flexibility and ease of use, especially in environments where storage needs change frequently.

#### 1. **Introduction to LVM**

LVM abstracts physical storage devices into logical volumes that can be easily resized and managed. It separates the physical storage into three layers:

- **Physical Volumes (PVs)**: The physical storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs) that you add to LVM.
- **Volume Groups (VGs)**: Collections of physical volumes combined into a single pool of storage.
- **Logical Volumes (LVs)**: The virtual partitions created from the volume groups, which you can use to create filesystems.

**Key Advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Easily resize logical volumes and filesystems without needing to repartition physical drives.
- **Snapshots**: Create snapshots of logical volumes, which are useful for backups and recovery.
- **Efficiency**: Combine multiple physical volumes into a single logical volume, avoiding wasted space.

#### 2. **Setting Up LVM**

**Step 1: Install LVM Tools**

Most Linux distributions include LVM tools by default, but if they are not installed, you can add them:

- **On Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install lvm2
  ```

- **On Red Hat/CentOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install lvm2
  ```

**Step 2: Prepare Physical Volumes (PVs)**

Convert your physical storage devices (e.g., `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`) into physical volumes.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Prepares the device `/dev/sdX` as a physical volume for LVM. Repeat this for each disk you want to add to the LVM system.

**Step 3: Create a Volume Group (VG)**

Combine one or more physical volumes into a volume group.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo vgcreate my_volume_group /dev/sdX /dev/sdY
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Creates a volume group named `my_volume_group` using the physical volumes `/dev/sdX` and `/dev/sdY`.

**Step 4: Create Logical Volumes (LVs)**

Logical volumes are created from the free space in a volume group. You can then format and mount these logical volumes like traditional partitions.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo lvcreate -L 50G -n my_logical_volume my_volume_group
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Creates a logical volume named `my_logical_volume` with a size of 50GB from the `my_volume_group` volume group.

**Step 5: Format and Mount the Logical Volume**

Format the logical volume with a filesystem and mount it for use.

- **Format the LV**:
  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
  ```

- **Create a mount point**:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /mnt/my_mount
  ```

- **Mount the LV**:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume /mnt/my_mount
  ```

**Step 6: Make Mount Permanent**

To ensure the logical volume mounts automatically on boot, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:

- **Example `/etc/fstab` Entry**:
  ```plaintext
  /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume  /mnt/my_mount  ext4  defaults  0  2
  ```

#### 3. **Managing LVM**

**a. Resizing Logical Volumes**

One of LVMâ€™s key benefits is the ability to resize volumes.

**To Extend a Logical Volume**:
- **Extend the LV**:
  ```bash
  sudo lvextend -L +10G /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Increases the size of `my_logical_volume` by 10GB.

- **Resize the Filesystem**:
  ```bash
  sudo resize2fs /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Resizes the filesystem on the logical volume to use the new space.

**To Reduce a Logical Volume**:
Reducing the size of a logical volume is more complex and requires careful steps to avoid data loss.

1. **First, resize the filesystem**:
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume 40G
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Shrinks the filesystem to 40GB (you must specify the new size).

2. **Then, reduce the LV size**:
   ```bash
   sudo lvreduce -L 40G /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Reduces the size of the logical volume to 40GB.

**b. Creating Snapshots**

LVM allows you to create snapshots of logical volumes, which are useful for backups.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo lvcreate -L 10G -s -n my_snapshot /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
  ```

  - **Explanation**: Creates a 10GB snapshot of `my_logical_volume` named `my_snapshot`. The snapshot will only grow up to 10GB as changes are made to the original volume.

**c. Removing Logical Volumes**

If a logical volume is no longer needed, you can remove it:

1. **Unmount the LV**:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/my_mount
   ```

2. **Remove the LV**:
   ```bash
   sudo lvremove /dev/my_volume_group/my_logical_volume
   ```

#### 4. **LPIC Reference**

**LPIC Topic**:
- **Topic 104: Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**
- **Subtopic 104.4: Use of `LVM`**

**Key Points**:
- Understand how to set up and configure LVM, including creating physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes.
- Be able to manage LVM, including resizing volumes, creating snapshots, and removing volumes.
- Know how to format and mount logical volumes for use in the filesystem.
