### 6.4. Available Memory / Disk Explained

Monitoring available memory and disk space is critical for maintaining the performance and stability of a Linux system. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of key concepts, commands, and how they relate to the LPIC-1 exam.

#### Key Concepts

**1. Available Memory:**

**Memory Types**:
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: The primary memory used by the system for running processes and storing data temporarily.
- **Swap**: Disk space used as virtual memory when the RAM is full.

**Key Commands**:

- **`free`**:
  - **Usage**: `free -h`
  - **Description**: Displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system. The `-h` option shows the output in a human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
  - **Example Output**:
    ```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:           7.8G        1.2G        5.6G        120M        1.0G        6.2G
    Swap:          2.0G          0B        2.0G
    ```
  - **Key Metrics**:
    - **Total**: The total installed memory.
    - **Used**: The amount of memory currently in use.
    - **Free**: The amount of memory that is not in use.
    - **Available**: Memory available for new applications.

- **`vmstat`**:
  - **Usage**: `vmstat`
  - **Description**: Provides detailed information about system processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity.
  - **Example Usage**: `vmstat 5` (updates every 5 seconds)
  - **Key Metrics**:
    - **Memory**: Free and used memory.
    - **Swap**: Swap in and swap out statistics.

**2. Available Disk Space:**

**Disk Space Types**:
- **Filesystem**: The structure on disk that organizes files and directories.
- **Inodes**: Data structures that store information about files and directories. Each file or directory consumes an inode.

**Key Commands**:

- **`df`** (Disk Filesystem):
  - **Usage**: `df -h`
  - **Description**: Reports the amount of disk space used and available on filesystems. The `-h` option shows the output in a human-readable format.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1        20G   15G  4.5G  77% /
    /dev/sdb1        50G   25G   23G  55% /home
    ```
  - **Key Metrics**:
    - **Size**: Total size of the filesystem.
    - **Used**: Amount of space used on the filesystem.
    - **Avail**: Amount of free space available on the filesystem.
    - **Use%**: Percentage of the filesystem that is used.

- **`du`** (Disk Usage):
  - **Usage**: `du -sh /path/to/directory`
  - **Description**: Estimates the file space usage of directories. The `-s` option provides a summary, and `-h` makes the output human-readable.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```
    1.2G    /var/log
    3.4G    /home/user
    ```
  - **Key Metrics**:
    - **Directory Size**: The total space used by a directory and its contents.

**Additional Tools**:

- **`iostat`** (Input/Output Statistics):
  - **Usage**: `iostat`
  - **Description**: Reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices and partitions. Useful for identifying disk I/O bottlenecks.

- **`ncdu`** (NCurses Disk Usage):
  - **Usage**: `ncdu /path`
  - **Description**: An interactive tool for analyzing disk usage in a more user-friendly way. It provides a visual representation of disk space usage.

#### LPIC Chapter Referenced

**Relevant LPIC-1 Chapter**:
- **Topic 103: GNU and Unix Commands**
- **Subtopic 103.4: Perform basic file management**
- **Subtopic 104.1: Manage system services using SysVinit and systemd**

**Focus for LPIC-1**:
- **Understanding Memory Usage**: Know how to use `free` and `vmstat` to monitor system memory and swap space.
- **Disk Space Management**: Be familiar with `df` and `du` for checking disk usage, identifying space issues, and managing disk resources.
- **Inode Monitoring**: Recognize the importance of inodes and how to monitor them using `df -i`.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Command Mastery**: Proficiency in using `free`, `vmstat`, `df`, and `du` is essential for system administration tasks.
- **Memory and Disk Interpretation**: Understand how to interpret the outputs from these commands to assess system performance and resource availability.
- **Practical Application**: Apply this knowledge to troubleshoot and resolve memory and disk space issues in a Linux environment.

In summary, monitoring available memory and disk space is a vital part of Linux system administration. These skills are covered in the LPIC-1 exam and are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of Linux systems.
