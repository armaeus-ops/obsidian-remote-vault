### 7.4. Process Priorities Explained

**Process priorities** in Linux control the allocation of CPU time to running processes. Adjusting process priorities allows you to influence how the system scheduler treats different processes, ensuring that critical tasks get the necessary resources while less important tasks can be deprioritized.

#### Key Concepts

**1. What Are Process Priorities?**

- **Definition**: Process priorities determine the order in which processes are given CPU time. Higher-priority processes get more CPU time, while lower-priority processes get less.

- **Nice Value**:
  - The **"nice" value** is a user-space metric used to adjust process priorities.
  - **Range**: The nice value ranges from `-20` (highest priority) to `19` (lowest priority).
  - **Default**: Most processes start with a default nice value of `0`.
  - A **lower nice value** means higher priority, and a **higher nice value** means lower priority.

- **Real-Time Priorities**:
  - Real-time processes have fixed priorities ranging from 0 to 99.
  - They are managed by the **real-time scheduler** and are not affected by nice values.

**2. Viewing Process Priorities:**

**Key Commands**:

- **`ps`**:
  - **Usage**: `ps -o pid,ni,pri,comm`
  - **Description**: Displays the PID, nice value (`ni`), priority (`pri`), and command (`comm`) of processes.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    ps -o pid,ni,pri,comm
    ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
        PID  NI PRI COMMAND
       1234   0  20 python
       2345  10  30 backup.sh
      ```
      - **`NI`**: Shows the nice value.
      - **`PRI`**: Shows the actual priority of the process.

- **`top`**:
  - **Usage**: `top`
  - **Description**: Displays real-time information about processes, including their priorities and nice values.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND           
   1234 user      20   0  300m  10m 2000 S   1.2  0.5   0:00.45 python          
   2345 user      30  10  100m   5m 1000 S   0.5  0.2   0:01.23 backup.sh       
    ```
    - **PR**: Priority of the process.
    - **NI**: Nice value of the process.

**3. Changing Process Priorities:**

**Key Commands**:

- **`nice`**:
  - **Usage**: `nice -n [niceness] command`
  - **Description**: Starts a process with a specific nice value.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    nice -n 10 ./backup.sh
    ```
    - Starts `backup.sh` with a nice value of `10`, meaning it will have lower priority than processes with a lower nice value.

- **`renice`**:
  - **Usage**: `renice [niceness] -p PID`
  - **Description**: Changes the nice value of an already running process.
  - **Common Options**:
    - **`-p PID`**: Specifies the process ID to renice.
    - **`-u user`**: Changes the nice value of all processes owned by the specified user.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    renice -n 5 -p 1234
    ```
    - Changes the nice value of the process with PID `1234` to `5`.

**4. Practical Use Cases:**

- **Running Background Tasks with Low Priority**:
  - For processes that are not time-sensitive, such as backups or batch processing, you can start them with a higher nice value (lower priority) to prevent them from affecting the performance of more critical tasks.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    nice -n 15 ./backup.sh
    ```

- **Boosting the Priority of Important Processes**:
  - For processes that need more CPU time, you can lower their nice value (increasing their priority) to ensure they run faster and more efficiently.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    renice -n -5 -p 2345
    ```
    - Increases the priority of the process with PID `2345`.

**5. Priority vs. Scheduling:**

- **Nice Value and Scheduling**:
  - The nice value is one of several factors that influence the process scheduling. While it is an important factor, the kernel also considers other factors like CPU usage history and I/O operations.
  - The actual **scheduling priority** (shown as `PR` in `top`) is derived from the nice value but also includes these other factors.

**6. Real-Time Processes:**

- **Real-Time Scheduling**:
  - Real-time processes are usually reserved for critical tasks that must execute within strict time constraints.
  - They have fixed priorities and are scheduled differently from normal processes, making them more predictable in terms of timing.

**Relevant LPIC-1 Chapter**:
- **Topic 103: GNU and Unix Commands**
- **Subtopic 103.5: Manage Processes**

**Focus for LPIC-1**:
- **Understanding Nice Values**: Know how to use `nice` and `renice` to adjust process priorities.
- **Command Proficiency**: Be comfortable viewing and interpreting process priorities using `ps`, `top`, and related commands.
- **Practical Application**: Understand when and why to adjust process priorities in a multi-tasking environment.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Nice Value**: Lower nice values mean higher priority, and higher nice values mean lower priority.
- **Using `nice`**: Start processes with a specified nice value.
- **Using `renice`**: Adjust the nice value of running processes.
- **Monitoring**: Use `ps` and `top` to monitor and manage process priorities effectively.

In summary, understanding and managing process priorities in Linux is crucial for ensuring that important tasks get the necessary resources while less critical tasks do not interfere with overall system performance. This knowledge is an essential part of process management and is covered in the LPIC-1 certification.
