### 8.2 Users and Groups

In Linux, users and groups are fundamental components for managing access control and organizing system resources. Understanding how to work with users and groups is essential for system administration. Here's a detailed overview of managing users and groups:

#### Users

**1. User Accounts**

- **Definition**: A user account represents an individual or a system process that can log in and use system resources. Each user is identified by a unique username and a user ID (UID).

- **Key Files**:
  - **`/etc/passwd`**: Contains user account information, such as username, UID, home directory, and default shell. Each line has the format:
    ```
    username:password:UID:GID:GECOS:home_directory:shell
    ```
  - **`/etc/shadow`**: Stores hashed passwords and additional account details such as password expiration and account locking. Each line has the format:
    ```
    username:hashed_password:last_change:min_age:max_age:warn_period:inactive_period:expire_date
    ```


#### Groups

**1. Group Accounts**

- **Definition**: Groups are collections of users. They allow you to manage permissions and access rights for multiple users at once. Each group has a unique group name and a group ID (GID).

- **Key Files**:
  - **`/etc/group`**: Contains group information, including group name, GID, and the list of members. Each line has the format:
    ```
    groupname:password:GID:user_list
    ```

**2. Managing Groups**

- **Creating a Group**:
  - **Command**: `groupadd`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    groupadd groupname
    ```
    - Creates a new group with the specified name.

- **Deleting a Group**:
  - **Command**: `groupdel`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    groupdel groupname
    ```
    - Deletes the specified group. Users in the group are not deleted but will no longer have group membership.

- **Modifying Group Information**:
  - **Command**: `groupmod`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    groupmod -n newgroupname oldgroupname
    ```
    - Renames an existing group from `oldgroupname` to `newgroupname`.

- **Adding/Removing Users from Groups**:
  - **Command**: `usermod` for adding users; `gpasswd` for group management.
  - **Example**:
    - **Add User to Group**:
      ```bash
      usermod -aG groupname username
      ```
      - Adds `username` to `groupname`. The `-a` option ensures the user is added to the group without removing them from other groups.
    - **Remove User from Group**:
      ```bash
      gpasswd -d username groupname
      ```
      - Removes `username` from `groupname`.

**3. Viewing Users and Groups**

- **List Users**:
  - **Command**: `cat /etc/passwd`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd
    ```
    - Displays a list of all user accounts.

- **List Groups**:
  - **Command**: `cat /etc/group`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/group
    ```
    - Displays a list of all groups and their members.

- **Check Group Membership**:
  - **Command**: `groups`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    groups username
    ```
    - Lists the groups that `username` belongs to.

#### Key Points for LPIC Certification

- **Understanding File Formats**: Know the format of `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group` files.
- **Common Commands**: Be proficient with `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`, `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel`.
- **User and Group Management**: Understand how to manage user accounts and groups, including creating, modifying, and deleting them.
- **Permissions and Ownership**: Know how user and group memberships affect file and directory permissions.

In summary, managing users and groups in Linux involves creating, modifying, and deleting user and group accounts, as well as handling permissions and ownership. This ensures proper access control and organization within the system. Mastery of these tasks is essential for effective Linux system administration and for passing the LPIC-1 certification.
