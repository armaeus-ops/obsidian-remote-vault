**Running services** refer to the processes or daemons that are currently active on a Linux system, providing various functionalities and capabilities. Managing these services is crucial for maintaining system performance, security, and stability.

#### Key Concepts

**1. Definition and Purpose:**
- **Services (or Daemons)**: Background processes that run continuously to provide specific functionalities such as web serving, file sharing, and system monitoring.
- **Service Management**: Involves starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of these services.

**2. Service Management Tools:**
The tools used to manage services depend on the init system used by the Linux distribution. The two primary init systems are `systemd` and the older `SysVinit`.

#### `systemd` (Most modern Linux distributions)

**Commands**:
- **`systemctl`**: The command-line utility for managing services in a `systemd` system.

  **Common Commands**:
  - **List all services**: 
    ```bash
    systemctl list-units --type=service
    ```
    - **Description**: Lists all active services and their statuses.
  
  - **Check the status of a specific service**:
    ```bash
    systemctl status service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Shows the current status, recent logs, and whether the service is active, inactive, or failed.

  - **Start a service**:
    ```bash
    systemctl start service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Starts the specified service.

  - **Stop a service**:
    ```bash
    systemctl stop service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Stops the specified service.

  - **Restart a service**:
    ```bash
    systemctl restart service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Restarts the specified service, useful for applying configuration changes.

  - **Enable a service to start at boot**:
    ```bash
    systemctl enable service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Configures the service to start automatically at boot time.

  - **Disable a service from starting at boot**:
    ```bash
    systemctl disable service_name
    ```
    - **Description**: Prevents the service from starting automatically at boot.

**Examples**:
- **Check status of the Apache web server**:
  ```bash
  systemctl status apache2
  ```
  - **Output**: Shows if Apache is running, inactive, or failed, along with recent logs.

- **Restart the SSH service**:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart ssh
  ```

#### `SysVinit` (Older or legacy systems)

**Commands**:
- **`service`**: The command used to manage services in systems using SysVinit.

  **Common Commands**:
  - **List all services**:
    ```bash
    service --status-all
    ```
    - **Description**: Lists the status of all services.

  - **Check the status of a specific service**:
    ```bash
    service service_name status
    ```
    - **Description**: Displays the current status of the specified service.

  - **Start a service**:
    ```bash
    service service_name start
    ```
    - **Description**: Starts the specified service.

  - **Stop a service**:
    ```bash
    service service_name stop
    ```
    - **Description**: Stops the specified service.

  - **Restart a service**:
    ```bash
    service service_name restart
    ```
    - **Description**: Restarts the specified service.

**Examples**:
- **Check status of the Apache web server**:
  ```bash
  service apache2 status
  ```

- **Restart the SSH service**:
  ```bash
  service ssh restart
  ```

#### LPIC Chapter Referenced

**Relevant LPIC-1 Chapter**:
- **Topic 104: System Services and Boot Management**
- **Subtopic 104.1: Manage system services using SysVinit and systemd**

**Focus for LPIC-1**:
- **Understanding Service Management**: Know how to use `systemctl` for `systemd` systems and `service` for SysVinit systems to manage services.
- **Service States**: Understand the various states a service can be in (e.g., active, inactive, failed).
- **Configuration**: Learn how to enable or disable services to start at boot time.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Command Usage**: Master the commands for starting, stopping, and checking the status of services.
- **Service Management**: Be familiar with both `systemd` and SysVinit commands, as different systems may use different init systems.
- **Practical Application**: Apply knowledge to manage essential services and ensure that they are running correctly for system stability and functionality.

In summary, managing running services is a crucial part of system administration, and understanding how to do so effectively is essential for maintaining a Linux system. For detailed information and official study materials, refer to the Linux Professional Instituteâ€™s resources.
