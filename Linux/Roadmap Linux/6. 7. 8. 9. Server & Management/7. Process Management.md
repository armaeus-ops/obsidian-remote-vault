### 7. Process Management: Brief Overview

**Process management** in Linux involves monitoring, controlling, and optimizing the execution of programs on the system. A process is an instance of a running program, and managing processes is crucial for system performance, stability, and resource allocation.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Processes**:
   - **Definition**: An active instance of a program. Each process is assigned a unique Process ID (PID).
   - **Types**:
     - **Foreground Processes**: Run interactively with user input.
     - **Background Processes**: Run without user interaction, typically as services or daemons.

2. **Process States**:
   - **Running**: The process is actively using the CPU.
   - **Sleeping**: The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O operation).
   - **Stopped**: The process is paused, often by a signal.
   - **Zombie**: A terminated process that hasn't been cleaned up by its parent.

3. **Key Commands**:
   - **`ps`**: Displays information about running processes.
   - **`top` / `htop`**: Provides a dynamic, real-time view of running processes and system resources.
   - **`kill` / `killall`**: Sends signals to processes to terminate or control them.
   - **`nice` / `renice`**: Adjusts the priority of a process.
   - **`bg` / `fg`**: Moves processes between the background and foreground.
   - **`jobs`**: Lists background jobs started in the current session.

4. **Signals**:
   - **SIGTERM**: Requests a process to terminate gracefully.
   - **SIGKILL**: Forces a process to terminate immediately.
   - **SIGSTOP** / **SIGCONT**: Pauses or resumes a process.

5. **Job Control**:
   - **Managing Jobs**: Allows you to manage multiple processes from a single terminal session, controlling their execution and priority.
