### 7.3. Process Signals Explained

**Process signals** are a key mechanism in Linux for controlling processes. Signals are used to communicate with processes, instructing them to perform specific actions, such as terminating, pausing, or continuing execution. Understanding how to use signals is crucial for effective process management.

#### Key Concepts

**1. What Are Process Signals?**

- **Definition**: A signal is a form of inter-process communication used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred. Signals can be sent by the system, by other processes, or manually by the user.

- **Common Signals**:
  - **`SIGTERM` (Signal 15)**: Terminate a process gracefully. The process can catch this signal and clean up before exiting.
  - **`SIGKILL` (Signal 9)**: Forcefully terminate a process. This signal cannot be caught or ignored; the process is killed immediately.
  - **`SIGINT` (Signal 2)**: Interrupt a process (usually initiated by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal).
  - **`SIGSTOP` (Signal 19)**: Pause a process. The process remains in memory but is not executed.
  - **`SIGCONT` (Signal 18)**: Resume a paused process.
  - **`SIGHUP` (Signal 1)**: Hang up signal. Originally sent when a terminal was disconnected; now often used to reload configuration files without restarting the process.

**2. Sending Signals to Processes:**

**Key Commands**:

- **`kill`**:
  - **Usage**: `kill [options] PID`
  - **Description**: Sends a signal to a process identified by its PID.
  - **Common Usage**:
    - **`kill PID`**: Sends the default `SIGTERM` signal to terminate the process.
    - **`kill -9 PID`**: Sends `SIGKILL` to forcefully terminate the process.
    - **`kill -s SIGNAL PID`**: Sends a specific signal to the process.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    kill 1234
    ```
    - Sends `SIGTERM` to the process with PID `1234`.

- **`killall`**:
  - **Usage**: `killall [options] process_name`
  - **Description**: Sends a signal to all processes with the specified name.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    killall firefox
    ```
    - Sends `SIGTERM` to all running `firefox` processes.

- **`pkill`**:
  - **Usage**: `pkill [options] pattern`
  - **Description**: Sends a signal to processes matching a pattern, such as a process name.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    pkill -9 python
    ```
    - Sends `SIGKILL` to all processes with names matching "python".

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - **`Ctrl + C`**: Sends `SIGINT` to the foreground process to interrupt it.
  - **`Ctrl + Z`**: Sends `SIGSTOP` to the foreground process to pause it.

**3. Handling Signals in Processes:**

- **Default Actions**:
  - Each signal has a default action that the process will take when receiving the signal, such as terminating, pausing, or ignoring it.

- **Signal Handling in Scripts**:
  - Processes and scripts can be programmed to handle signals explicitly using signal handlers. For example, a process may catch `SIGTERM` to perform cleanup tasks before exiting.

**4. Practical Use Cases**:

- **Graceful Termination**:
  - Use `SIGTERM` to terminate a process gracefully, allowing it to close files and release resources properly.
  - Example: `kill 2345` sends `SIGTERM` to PID `2345`.

- **Forceful Termination**:
  - Use `SIGKILL` when a process is unresponsive and cannot be terminated by `SIGTERM`.
  - Example: `kill -9 2345` forcefully kills the process with PID `2345`.

- **Pausing and Resuming Processes**:
  - Use `SIGSTOP` to pause a process, and `SIGCONT` to resume it.
  - Example: Pausing a process with `kill -STOP 2345` and resuming it with `kill -CONT 2345`.

- **Reloading Configurations**:
  - Use `SIGHUP` to reload a processâ€™s configuration files without restarting it.
  - Example: `kill -HUP 2345` reloads the configuration of the process with PID `2345`.

**5. Viewing Available Signals**:

- **`kill -l`**:
  - **Usage**: `kill -l`
  - **Description**: Lists all available signals and their corresponding numbers.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```
    1) SIGHUP  2) SIGINT  3) SIGQUIT  4) SIGILL  5) SIGTRAP
    6) SIGABRT 7) SIGBUS  8) SIGFPE  9) SIGKILL 10) SIGUSR1
    ...
    ```
    - Shows the available signals, which can be used with commands like `kill`.

**Relevant LPIC-1 Chapter**:
- **Topic 103: GNU and Unix Commands**
- **Subtopic 103.5: Manage Processes**

**Focus for LPIC-1**:
- **Command Mastery**: Know how to use `kill`, `killall`, and `pkill` to send signals to processes.
- **Signal Awareness**: Understand the purpose and effects of common signals like `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGINT`, `SIGSTOP`, and `SIGHUP`.
- **Practical Application**: Be able to apply signals in real-world scenarios, such as gracefully shutting down processes or forcefully terminating unresponsive ones.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Signal Types**: Recognize the most commonly used signals and their numbers (e.g., `SIGKILL` = 9).
- **Sending Signals**: Use `kill`, `killall`, and `pkill` to send signals to processes.
- **Signal Handling**: Understand how processes can handle signals, including default actions and custom handlers.

In summary, process signals are a critical tool for managing and controlling processes in Linux. Mastering the use of these signals is essential for effective process management and is a key topic in the LPIC-1 certification.
