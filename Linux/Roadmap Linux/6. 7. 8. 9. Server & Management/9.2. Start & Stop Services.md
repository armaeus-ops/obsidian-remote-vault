### 9.2. Starting and Stopping Services with `systemd`

Managing the state of services—whether starting them when needed or stopping them when they're not—is a fundamental task in Linux system administration. With `systemd`, this management is streamlined through the `systemctl` command. Here’s how to start and stop services using `systemd`.

#### 1. **Starting Services**

**Command**:
```bash
systemctl start service_name
```

**Description**:
- This command starts the specified service immediately.
- It does not enable the service to start at boot; it only affects the current session.

**Examples**:

- **Start the `apache2` Service**:
  ```bash
  systemctl start apache2
  ```
  - This starts the Apache HTTP server service.

- **Start a Service and Check Its Status**:
  ```bash
  systemctl start nginx
  systemctl status nginx
  ```
  - Starts the `nginx` service and then checks its status to confirm it is running.

#### 2. **Stopping Services**

**Command**:
```bash
systemctl stop service_name
```

**Description**:
- This command stops the specified service immediately.
- It does not disable the service from starting at boot; it only affects the current session.

**Examples**:

- **Stop the `mysql` Service**:
  ```bash
  systemctl stop mysql
  ```
  - This stops the MySQL database service.

- **Stop a Service and Check Its Status**:
  ```bash
  systemctl stop postgresql
  systemctl status postgresql
  ```
  - Stops the `postgresql` service and then checks its status to confirm it has stopped.

#### 3. **Starting and Stopping Services Automatically at Boot**

To control whether a service starts automatically when the system boots, use the `enable` and `disable` commands.

**Enable a Service**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl enable service_name
  ```
- **Description**:
  - Configures the service to start automatically at boot time.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  systemctl enable ssh
  ```
  - Configures the SSH service to start on boot.

**Disable a Service**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl disable service_name
  ```
- **Description**:
  - Prevents the service from starting automatically at boot time.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  systemctl disable bluetooth
  ```
  - Prevents the Bluetooth service from starting on boot.

#### 4. **Restarting and Reloading Services**

In addition to starting and stopping services, you may need to restart or reload services to apply configuration changes or refresh their state.

**Restart a Service**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart service_name
  ```
- **Description**:
  - Stops and then starts the service. Useful for applying configuration changes.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart apache2
  ```
  - Restarts the Apache HTTP server service.

**Reload a Service**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl reload service_name
  ```
- **Description**:
  - Reloads the service’s configuration without stopping it. Not all services support reloading.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  systemctl reload nginx
  ```
  - Reloads the configuration of the Nginx web server.

#### 5. **Understanding Service Dependencies**

When starting or stopping services, be aware of service dependencies, which might affect other services. `systemd` manages dependencies automatically, but knowing the dependencies can help with troubleshooting.

**Check Dependencies**:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl list-dependencies service_name
  ```
- **Description**:
  - Lists units that are required or dependent on the specified service.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  systemctl list-dependencies apache2
  ```
  - Lists dependencies for the `apache2` service.

#### Summary

**Key Commands**:
- **Start a Service**: `systemctl start service_name`
- **Stop a Service**: `systemctl stop service_name`
- **Enable a Service**: `systemctl enable service_name`
- **Disable a Service**: `systemctl disable service_name`
- **Restart a Service**: `systemctl restart service_name`
- **Reload a Service**: `systemctl reload service_name`

**Usage Tips**:
- Use `start` and `stop` for immediate service state changes.
- Use `enable` and `disable` to manage services at boot time.
- Use `restart` to apply configuration changes, and `reload` to refresh service settings without downtime.

**Key Points**:
- **Immediate vs. Persistent State**: Understand the difference between starting/stopping services immediately and enabling/disabling them for boot time.
- **Managing Configuration Changes**: Use `restart` or `reload` to apply changes to service configurations.

Effective management of service states ensures that services are running as needed and are properly configured to start or stop automatically, contributing to the stability and performance of your Linux system.
